# Just an idea pops up into my mind
> Its about re writing/designing our books for all the possible devices we might have.

## What if we could make it universal?
> universal in a sense we separate all of its contents/parts into sevarales individual unit.

> later we re-use it for producing/making/generating pdf, html or any other format relevant with publishing

> thus we make sure all of our resources are re-using over time and media. (web,mobileApp,pdf)

## Our book content consist of:
* Text
* Illustration (Visuals/grpahics)/(png,jpeg files)
* Style for design

## Later we may re-use as follows:

* Text - copy
* Illustration -> copy
* style -> css

## Publishing:
* Website
* Mobile app (android,ios)
* Desktop app
* Pdf reader
* Epub reader
