# Just an idea pops up into my mind
> Its about re writing/designing our books for all the possible devices we might have.

## What if we could make it universal?
> Universal in a sense that separates all its contents / parts into multiple separate units.

> We will be able to reuse it later to create / generate PDF, HTML or any other format relevant to the publishing platforms.

> This way we ensure all of our content is being reused over time and on publishing platforms.

## Our book content consist of:
* Text
* Illustration (Visuals/grpahics)/(png,jpeg files)
* Style for design

## Later we may re-use as follows:

* Text - copy
* Illustration -> copy
* style -> css

## Publishing platforms
* Website
* Mobile app (android,ios)
* Desktop app
* Pdf reader
* Epub reader

## How it works?
* At first you make each page templates (for our book)
* Create templates using Illustrator or Figma or any tool of your choice.
* Later Moaz or Imran will turn these into html,css
* We will create every unit using web component
* Once the web components are created, we can use them on various publishing platforms.
